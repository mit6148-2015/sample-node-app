# User Research

1. What problem does your application address, and how does your application address it?
2. What are the killer features of your application?
3. Identify and briefly describe your target demographic. Who do you envision using your site?
4. Develop at least one use case for your site. This should be a list or table demonstrating a sequence of user actions and website responses that occur when a user attempts to complete a core task on your site. Make sure to indicate the task the user is trying to complete.

3. What technology do you plan to use for your server-side programming (e.g. PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc)?
